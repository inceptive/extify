TESTS
=====


We need to implement more functionallity tests for sure.
This project mostly is based on the OOP foundation code of Ext Core 3.1.
This piece of code is tested in thousends of projects and very stable.
(Ext JS 3 is based on this code for example)

So we can aspire this code to be likely stable.

But for sure, there should be more tests and they will be implemented in
the future. If you want to provide test cases, just mail me to:
