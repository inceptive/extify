Extify
======


Extify is a powerful multiplatform FLOSS JavaScript framework developed by Aron Homberg of INCEPTIVE.
It's a free implementation of the Ext JS 4 core framework which is running on
any JavaScript platform. (Browser, Node JS, Rhino, Embedded etc.)

It features a solid OOP layer incl. multiple inheritance, an observer pattern,
templating, data type enahncements, managed global variable handling, a solid data
API based uppon Backbone JS, code execution control (delayed tasks, taskrunner CRON)
etc. and is well documentated at all.

Extify is the Core foundation framework of Extode (FLOSS ExtJS-style Node JS framework)
and Extanium 2 (FLOSS ExtJS-style Appcelerator Titanium framework).

Thank you for using Extify!
