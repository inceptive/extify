Documentation
=============


Currently the docs are generated by the software of ext-doc.org.
This generated documentation uses AJAX to load the documentation pages asynchronously.
To read the docs you need to set up an webserver (just for static HTML file delivery)
and point it's docroot into this directory.

In the upcomming versions of Extify we will switch to the newer JSDuck documentation
tool which uses a different approach and doesn't requires a webserver instance.

Thank you for using Extify!
